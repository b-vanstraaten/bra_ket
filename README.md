This is a Rust-based quantum simulator that provides an identical interface for state vector and density matrix simulations. It is fully parallelized using the Rayon library. This project was developed as a learning exercise in Rust programming and qubit simulation.

## Features

- Simulate quantum circuits using state vector or density matrix representations.
- Support for common quantum gates and operations.
- Parallelized simulation for improved performance on multi-core processors.
- User-friendly interface for defining and running quantum circuits.

## Installation

To use this quantum simulator, you need to have Rust and Cargo (Rust's package manager) installed on your system. If you don't have Rust installed, you can download it from the official website: [Rust Installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
then add it as dependancy in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bra_ket = "0.1.3"
```
Make sure to replace `"0.1.2"` with the actual version number from the release you want to use.

Then, in your Rust code:
```rust
use bra_ket::*;
fn main() {

    // creating the quantum program 
    let mut program = Program::new();
    program.h(0);
    program.cnot(0, 1);
    program.cnot(0, 2);

    // drawing the program 
    program.draw();

    // creating a three qubit state vector / density matrix to hold the quantum state
    let mut state_vector = StateVector::new(3);
    let mut density_matrix = DensityMatrix::new(3);

    // running the program to evolve the state vector from its 
    //initial state of |000> to (1 / SQRT_2) *(|000> + |111>)
    program.run(&mut state_vector);
    program.run(&mut density_matrix);

    // printing the final state vector / density matrix
    println!("state vector \n{}", state_vector);
    println!("density matrix \n{}", density_matrix);
}
```
This code produces the GHZ state (1 / SQRT_2) *(|000> + |111>) in both state vector and density matrix representations.
